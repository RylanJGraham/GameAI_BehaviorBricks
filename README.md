# GameAI Exercise 05: Behaviour Bricks
## About
The following repository was created to host class exercise 05 from Game AI lesson in CITM UPC university.

The main objective of this exercise was to implement a **Behaviour Bricks** system with some AI algorithms like Wandering, Approaching, and Hiding to recreate a scene where there is a Cop and a Robber, and the Robber wants to steal a Treasure but the Cop is trying to stop him. To do so, we used Unity game engine in its **2023.3.3 version** and some free assets from the Unity Assets Store and then we implemented the algorithm using C# Unity scripts.
